Knowledge Extraction Restriction for Digital Entities License

A license to restrict the use of any asset in a directory for use in Machine Learning, AI, or NFT related activities.

Basically:

```
if restrictions met then
  do not use or email me
else
  License + MIT license
```

Still a Work in Progress
